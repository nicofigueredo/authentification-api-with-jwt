# Authentification api with JWT

_Simple authentification api with user register, user login, and private resources endpoints._

## Getting started üöÄ

_These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes._

## Prerequisites üìã

_Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:_

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

## Downloading :arrow_down:
_There are several ways you can get the project:_

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the project is to use git to directly clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nicofigueredo/authentification-api-with-jwt.git
```

This will clone the latest version of the project repository to a **authentification-api-with-jwt** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to get the project is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/nicofigueredo/authentification-api-with-jwt/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/nicofigueredo/authentification-api-with-jwt/archive/master.zip -O authentification-api-with-jwt.zip; unzip authentification-api-with-jwt.zip; rm authentification-api-with-jwt.zip
```

Don't forget to rename **authentification-api-with-jwt** after your project name.

## Installing üîß

Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` file that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

_To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:_

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.

## Running Your Application :running:

_Run your application using npm:_

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
That's it! Your application should be running.
